  "Financial stress doesn’t just affect money—it affects sleep, decisions, and self-worth. When income is unstable, your first job is not ambition; it’s reducing pressure and protecting clarity.",
  "Being short on money does not mean you’re irresponsible or incapable. It usually means you’ve been surviving systems that were never designed to be forgiving.",
  "When money is tight, everything feels urgent. Pause before reacting. The calmest decision today is often the most profitable one long term.",
  "You are allowed to rebuild financially without shame. Many people who look “ahead” are quietly drowning in debt and regret."
